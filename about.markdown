The University of Auckland Crypto and NFT Clubâ€™s objective is to connect
passionate students and educate students about the crypto space. Being a
one of a kind association, the club offers a unique experience and exposure
to our members by displaying a range of career pathways into the crypto
industry. This involves events that range from workshops, networking, to a
variety of speaker events. We also produce a bulletin magazine that is sent
out to students and other members.
